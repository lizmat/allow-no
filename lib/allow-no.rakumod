=head1 NAME

allow-no - provide %*SUB-MAIN-OPTS<allow-no> for older Rakudos

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use allow-no;

sub MAIN(:$foo, :$bar) {
    # calling script with --foo, --no-bar
    say $foo;  # True
    say $bar;  # False
}


=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<allow-no> module provides functionality that has been provided by
Rakudo 2022.08 and higher: it allows command line parameters to indicate
a C<False> flag to be specified as C<--no-foo> as well as the standard
allowed C<--/foo> or C<--foo-False>.

Using this module will run an INIT block that will perform the necessary
transformation on C<@*ARGS>.  No further action or configuration is
needed.
