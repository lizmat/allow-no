NAME
====

allow-no - provide %*SUB-MAIN-OPTallow-no for older Rakudos

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use allow-no;

sub MAIN(:$foo, :$bar) {
    # calling script with --foo, --no-bar
    say $foo;  # True
    say $bar;  # False
}
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `allow-no` module provides functionality that has been provided by Rakudo 2022.08 and higher: it allows command line parameters to indicate a `False` flag to be specified as `--no-foo` as well as the standard allowed `--/foo` or `--foo-False`.

Using this module will run an INIT block that will perform the necessary transformation on `@*ARGS`. No further action or configuration is needed.
